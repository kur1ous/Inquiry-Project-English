                    <h2>The Study</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 1944, physiologist Ancel Keys recruited 36 conscientious subjects, young men who had refused
                        combat on moral grounds, for a year-long study on starvation and recovery. These were not
                        ordinary subjects; they were selected specifically for their <strong>strong moral
                            convictions</strong>.
                    </p>

                        <p class="card__content">
                            For six months, participants were restricted to approximately 1,560 calories per day, about
                            half their normal intake. They were required to walk 22 miles per week and perform various
                            tasks.

                            The goal was to simulate conditions faced by famine victims in war-torn Europe and develop

                            Participants lost approximately 25% of their body weight. They experienced chronic weakness,
                            dizziness, edema, and heart problems. Their metabolisms slowed dramatically as their bodies
                            fought to conserve energy.

                            Men who had been warm and engaged became withdrawn, irritable, and self-obsessed.
                            Conversations narrowed to food. Friendships dissolved. Several participants reported that
                            they simply <strong>stopped caring</strong> about others.

                            One man, overcome with guilt about eating food scraps, cut off three of his own fingers. The
                            moral agony of violating their principles coexisted with the inability to resist.

                    <p>
                        During the recovery phase, as adequate nutrition returned, so did the men's moral characters.
                        Their empathy returned. Their irritability subsided. They became recognizably
                        <em>themselves</em> again.

                    <p>
                        But the experience left permanent marks. Many participants spent the rest of their lives unable
                        to waste food. Several dedicated their careers to hunger relief, haunted by what they had
                        learned about human fragility.

                            Consider: These were men of extraordinary moral conviction. Yet starvation broke them. What
                            does this reveal about conscience?

                                The Minnesota Experiment demonstrates that conscience has <strong>physiological
                                    preconditions</strong>. Moral behavior is not a disembodied act of will, it requires
                                a brain adequately fueled and functioning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This supports a <em>materialist</em> view of conscience: moral cognition, like all
                                cognition, depends on biological infrastructure. Damage that infrastructure, whether
                                through lesions, trauma, or starvation, and moral capacity degrades.
                            </p>

                                Under sufficiently extreme conditions,
                                almost anyone can be reduced to moral collapse. The participants were
                                selected for their moral strength, and it was not enough.
                            </p>

                                Recovery of moral character tracked recovery of
                                nutrition. The men were not permanently broken. This suggests the moral damage was to
                                their temporarily impaired biological substrate.
